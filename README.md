# Not Your Mama's ASP.NET

This is the sample code for my [devICT](http://devict.org) talk.  You can find the [slides here](http://slides.com/andyedinborough/not-your-mamas-aspnet).

## Branches

[console](https://github.com/andyedinborough/not-your-mamas-aspnet/tree/console): This is a simple console app to show just how minimal a dotnetcore app can be.

[minimal-web](https://github.com/andyedinborough/not-your-mamas-aspnet/tree/minimal-web):  This is the simplest version of a dotnetcore web app.

[minimal-mvc](https://github.com/andyedinborough/not-your-mamas-aspnet/tree/minimal-mvc):  Now getting a little more complex, this is a simple MVC implementation.

[mvc](https://github.com/andyedinborough/not-your-mamas-aspnet/tree/mvc):  This is the app that you are given with `dotnet new mvc`.

[sample](https://github.com/andyedinborough/not-your-mamas-aspnet/tree/mvc):  This is something closer to a real world web application, including database access.
